Audience?
Aims/ Goals - Notes from Sanderson
Approach
Project Motivation

Symbols/Acronyms

-Background- 5 pages
Dijkstra/Kruskal/Prims - Overview of them
Learning Tools (Psychology) - What makes a good teacher?
UX Design. What makes a good app.
Research other tools. See what they do/dont have. What is different in my application compared to others? Perhaps images of their work.

Extra - compare graph libraries?

-Spec & Design - 10 pages
Talk about libraries/technologies. What & why?
System Requirements
JavaScipt/HTML/CSS - What & why?
Architecture of web application. More talk about the code impelemented. What & why?
User Experience for my application.
Fill with Diagrams of MVC.
Fill with a mock diagram of a user using the applicaiton.
Has my designed changed? New technolgies? Add that.
Screenshot of my application 
JQuery
Talk about MST???

ZOOM

JSON
black background?
examples of websites with good ux?

maybe comparison of graph libraries?


-Implementation- 10 pages
- adjency matrix/list
session/user session.
Talk about code to the finer level. (Only important bits)
Images of my implementation of Dijkstar/Kruskal/Prims? n time
Any problems and how they were dealt. Lack of documentation/complexity.
Maybe problems with time complexity.
Talk about how the website is hosted.
JSON - printscreen of graph structure
walk through code and see what will be used
Default colour scheme - blind people
Talk about the time complexity for all the functions
node and edge labels?
talk about drag?
speed optimization? min.js'
dark website web design complications
downloaded libraries so that can use local files if no connectivity.

-TESTING 5-10 pages

performance testing/looking at google stats?
selenium + java add this 

-Result & Evaluation 10 pages
What extent have i achieved my goals?
Evaluate my application algorithm times.
Demos in open day.
sigma contains unit tests
time to compute x number of nodes
Demos to other Computer Science stude`nts
What about testing? Make automation test. Talk about manual testing with other people. Fake survery. Maybe say that most people not aware of some tool.
Compare the two web applications.
Website Speed/Settings/HTML 5 / CSS Ready compatabible
Code standards
disadvantages of adjecey list
problems/.?
graph of the time of execution?
screenshots of chrome activity manager while running the application
time of running certain algorithms

- Project Planning - 5 pages 
 Sprint plan. Follow it up? talk about all the sprints in detail
 the software i used for sticking tasks
 GitHub

Further Work and Conclusions 
Other Algorithms? A*/BFS/DFS
Mobile?
could add library testing to final year report too
Summary of project. What has been learnt/achieved.
