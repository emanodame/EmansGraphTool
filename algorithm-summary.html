        In applications using graphs it is often necessary
        to find the shortest path from one vertex to another.
        <br>
        <b>Dijkstra’s algorithm</b> determines the shortest paths from a
        given vertex to all other vertices for which paths exist; if we
        require the shortest path to a given vertex we can stop as soon
        as that has been found. If the algorithm is applied to a
        connected undirected graph the edges in the paths found will
        form a spanning tree, but this will not necessarily be a
        minimum cost spanning tree. The running time for Dijkstra's
        algorithm is O(n^2).

        <b>Kruskal’s algorithm </b> is a greedy minimum spanning tree algorithm
        which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects
        any two trees in the forest. It builds a minimum cost spanning tree by
        selecting lowest-cost edges from anywhere in the graph instead
        of building outwards from a single vertex. Hence the MCST is
        not necessarily connected at intermediate stages. The running time
        for Kruskal's is O(e log e).

        <b>Prim's algorithm</b> is also a greedy minimum spanning tree
        that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph.
        The basic idea behind <b>Prim’s algorithm</b> is to choose any
        vertex as a starting point and then gradually build a spanning
        tree by adding edges with minimal weights. At all intermediate
        stages the spanning tree being built will be connected.
